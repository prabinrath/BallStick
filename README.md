# BallStick
A desktop flash game to balance a ball on a stick. Implementation of Machine learning techniques to play the game autonomously and achieve highest possible score. An attempt to solve a real world balancing problem with the help of different machine learning algorithms in a simulated environment.

This branch has code for a supervised MLP model. The branch [master_ga](https://github.com/prabinrath/BallStick/tree/master_ga) has the code for training the MLP with Genetic Algorithm.

## Requirements

The project is developed for a Linux OS that uses:

* OpenGL
* GLUT
* Bullet Physics Engine
* Keras ML Wrapper with Tensorflow
* C++ X11 library support
* C++ pthread
